　　Our research focuses on the genetic mechanism of plant evolution utilizing the data of multi-omics. It specifically includes: 1) to explore the origin and evolutionary mechanism of important organs in terrestrial plants with fern and lycophytes as the research subject; 2) to investigate the prevalence of deleterious mutations in the process of domestication, migration and breeding of crops employing population genetic methods.

　　1) Through whole-genome resequencing, we unveiled the bottleneck effect of maize domestication and a series of founder effects during the process of range expansion. The population demography affected the prevalence of deleterious mutations in the maize population.
　　2) We revealed the genetic mechanism of parallel highland adaptation in multiple maize populations;
　　3) Using high depth whole-genome resequencing data, we explored the dynamics of deleterious mutations in 350 maize inbred lines across 60 years’ breeding history;
　　4) We disclosed the genetic mechanism of sex differentiation in Populus balsamifera with employment of population transcriptomic data, and how adaptation to high latitude environments reshaped the transcriptomes of the species.
