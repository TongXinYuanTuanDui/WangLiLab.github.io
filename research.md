Our research focuses on the genetic mechanism of plant evolution utilizing the data of multi-omics. It specifically includes: 1) to explore the origin and evolutionary mechanism of important organs in terrestrial plants with fern and lycophytes as the research subject; 2) to investigate the prevalence of deleterious mutations in the process of domestication, migration and breeding of crops employing population genetic methods.
